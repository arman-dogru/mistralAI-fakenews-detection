The rate of warming according to the data is much slower than the models used by the IPCC,0
The ­atmospheric residency time of carbon dioxide is five years,0
"Sea-level rise does not seem to depend on ocean temperature, and certainly not on CO2",0
There isn’t yet any empirical evidence for their claim that greenhouse gases even cause temperatures to increase.,0
[climate scientists] say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse.,1
"The IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is sort of the voice of the consensus, concedes that there has been no increase in extreme weather events.",0
"according, again, to the official figures—during this past 10 years, if anything, mean global temperature, average world temperature, has slightly declined",0
Most likely the primary control knob [on climate change] is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.,1
'Global warming' is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017.,1
global warming ceased around the end of the twentieth century and was followed (since 1997) by 19 years of stable temperature,0
Increases in atmospheric CO2 followed increases in temperature.,1

"Carbon emissions are declining in most rich nations and have been declining in Britain, Germany, and France since the mid-1970s",1
Preventing future pandemics requires more not less “industrial” agriculture,0
"As a result, half of the people surveyed around the world last year said they thought climate change would make humanity extinct.",1
"And in January, one out of five British children told pollsters they were having nightmares about climate change.",1
Previous IPCC reports tended to assume that clouds would have a neutral impact because the warming and cooling feedbacks would cancel each other out.,1
"“Catherine Senior, head of understanding climate change at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said more studies and more data were needed to fully understand the role of clouds and aerosols.",1
"Extreme melting and changes to the climate like this has released pressure on to the continent, allowing the ground to rise up.",1
"Small increases in average temperature translate to big increases in the number of extremely hot days, and those hot days have a big impact.",1
"As the temperature has increased, so has the ability of scientists to determine whether specific events are linked to climate change.",1

Hurricane Harvey gave Houston and the surrounding region a $125 billion lesson about the costs of misjudging the potential for floods,1
"In the early 2000s, ice shelves began disintegrating in several parts of Antarctica, and scientists realized that process could greatly accelerate the demise of the vastly larger ice sheets themselves.",1
However the warming trend is slower than most climate models have forecast,0
In 1990 the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted that temperatures would rise by 0.54F (0.3C) per decade.,1
"In its 5th assessment report in 2013, the IPCC estimated that human emissions are probably responsible for more than half of the observed increase in global average temperature from 1951 to 2010.",1
"at the end of recent ice ages, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise only after temperatures began to climb.",0
"But by far the largest greenhouse gas is water vapour, which makes 95 per cent of the total.",1
it’s virtually impossible to get funded for work that disputes climate change through other channels [other than oil companies],1
One of the main areas of contention is the existence of two strange climate episodes known as The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age.,1
"The MWP lasted from about 950 to 1250AD, and temperature records appear to show it was even hotter than today",1
But the period has caused a headache for climate scientists because clearly there was no upswell in carbon dioxide that could account for such swift warming.,1
"it later emerged that its creator Dr Michael Mann had spliced too [sic] datasets together – tree-rings showing temperatures going back hundreds of years, then recent thermometer readings for the more recent decades.",1
"Some scientists believe that solar activity is more likely to influence today’s climate than carbon dioxide, and Dr Soon has compiled data showing temperature in America, Canada and Mexico rises and falls in line with solar activity.",0
The melting ice has led to global sea level rise of around eight inches since reliable record keeping began in 1880.,1
until temperature increases began to slow down after 1998 and remained relatively stable for a period of 15 years,1
"In one particularly damning email, CRU director Phil Jones said he had used ‘Mike’s Nature trick’ to ‘hide the decline’ in temperatures in the second half of the 20th century.",1
"In an interview with the BBC after the scandal broke, Dr Jones admitted there had been no statistically significant global warming since 1995",0
The panel was forced to retract a statement in its 2007 report saying all Himalayan glaciers could melt entirely by 2035.,1
The figure traditionally cited that suggests 97 per cent of climate scientists agree that global warming is man-made was also found to be flawed.,0
"Climate skeptics argue temperature records have been adjusted in recent years to make the past appear cooler and the present warmer, although the Carbon Brief showed that NOAA has actually made the past warmer, evening out the difference.",0
"When the measuring equipment gets old and needs replacing, it often requires re-calibration.",1
A global network of 500 scientists and professionals has prepared this urgent message.,1
The Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850.,1
Only very few peer-reviewed papers even go so far as to say that recent warming is chiefly anthropogenic.,0
There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying[…] droughts,0
"For instance, wind turbines kill birds and insects, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests",1
"[data] show only slight warming, mostly at night and in winter",1
"there has been no systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events,",0
the models predicted seven times as much warming as has been observed,0
"Most of the atmospheric moisture originates in the tropical ocean, and the difference between surface and upper atmospheric temperature determines how much of the moisture rises into the atmosphere.",0

"While members of the media may nod along to such claims [about changes in weather extremes], the evidence paints a different story",1
"Globally there’s no clear evidence of trends and patterns in extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes and floods.",0
There’s no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the U.S.,0
Nor is there evidence of an increase in floods globally.,0
"Since 1965, more parts of the U.S. have seen a decrease in flooding than have seen an increase.",0
The bottom line is there’s no solid connection between climate change and the major indicators of extreme weather,0
"This requires us to work towards avoiding catastrophic possibilities rather than looking at probabilities, as learning from mistakes is not an option when it comes to existential risks.",1
"North America suffers extreme weather events including wildfires, drought, and heatwaves.",1
"The knock-on consequences affect national security, as the scale of the challenges involved, such as pandemic disease outbreaks, are overwhelming.",1
The most recent IPCC report lays out a future if we limit global heating to 1.5°C instead of the Paris Agreement’s 2°C.,0

"Like countless other organ­isms, we move and adapt when the environment changes.",1
"whenever in the past there was an explosion of plant life, the carbon dioxide content was far higher than at present.",0
"If we halve the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere, all life dies.",0
"for thousands of millions of years the Earth has been changing, with cycles­ and one-off events such as an asteroid impact, super-volcano or a supernova explosion.",1
[subsidies for wind and solar] add to emissions because coal-fired elec­tricity needs to be on standby for when there is no wind or sunshine.,0
The amount of energy used to construct solar and wind facilities is greater than they produce in their working lives.,0
"“As soon as renewables were introduced into the grid, electric­ity prices increased and delivery became unreliable.",0
"Renew­ables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous because they pollute a huge land area, slice and dice birds and bats, kill insects that are bird food, create health problems for humans who live within kilometres of them, leave toxins around the turbine site and despoil the landscape.",0
"there were no ice sheets covering either Greenland or West Antarctica, and much of the East Antarctic ice sheet was gone.",0
a study that totally debunks the whole concept of man-made Global Warming,0
nothing we can do to stop the Earth’s naturally occurring climate cycles.,1
Climate Change ‘Heat Records’ Are a Huge Data Manipulation,1
The idea that climate change is producing heat records across the Earth is among the most egregious manipulations of data in the absurd global warming debate.,0
"On Feb. 7, several major newspapers carried stories of the declaration by NASA and NOAA that the past five years have been the warmest on record.",1
Actual weather records over the past 100 years show no correlation between rising carbon dioxide levels and local temperatures.,0
"However, since 1998, little warming has occurred while carbon dioxide emissions continue to increase.",0
"describes a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040",1
"But the heads of small island nations, fearful of rising sea levels, had also asked scientists to examine the effects of 2.7 degrees of warming.",1
Brooks added that Antarctic ice is growing.,0
"“But there are plenty of studies that have come that show with respect to Antarctica that the total ice sheet, particularly that above land, is increasing, not decreasing.",0
"The unusual heat was most noteworthy in Europe, which had its warmest April on record, and Australia, which had its second-warmest.",1
There is no empirical evidence that increasing greenhouse gases are the primary cause of Global Warming,0
"“Today climate scientists are obsessed with the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, a very very small part of the overall picture.",0
Carbon dioxide is a trace gas.”,1
"“Every day, nature puts twenty times as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as all of Earth industries.",1
If we double atmospheric carbon dioxide[…] we’d only raise global surface temperatures by about a degree Celsius.,0
"“So the bottom line of all this is that climate change is natural, not man-made.",0
Man-made greenhouse gases play only an insignificant role.”,0
Climate scientists are telling us it’s likely we’re going to be in for a period of cooling.,0
"Ocean levels have been rising for the last 20,000 years[…] No climate scientist can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man-made sea level rise began.",0
"Sea ice continued its declining trend, both in the Arctic and Antarctic.",1
Scientists say halting deforestation ‘just as urgent’ as reducing emissions,1
"It is expected the report will focus on required changes to the energy system, rather than forests.",1
Losing tropical forests is not somehow cheaper than putting up wind farms in the US or Sahara.”,1
IPCC report warning last week the world is “nowhere near on track” to meet its Paris commitments,1
"But like most claims regarding global warming, the real effect is small, probably temporary, and most likely due to natural weather patterns",0
The 30 most costly hurricanes in U.S. history (according to federal data from January) show no increase in intensity over time.,0
"“During the sunless winter, a heatwave raised concerns that the polar vortex may be eroding.",1
water vapour has been the main greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide has had a minuscule effect on global climate,0
"For the past 4567 million years, the sun and the Earth’s orbit have driven climate change cycles.",1
"Since then, the planet has been cooling on a millennial scale",1
Our evolving dynamic planet has survived[…] mass extinctions,1
South Australia is winning: it has the most unreliable grid in the world outside Africa and the most expensive electricity.,1
Domino-effect of climate events could move Earth into a ‘hothouse’ state,1
"Previous studies have shown that weakening carbon sinks will add 0.25°C, forest dieback will add 0.11°C, permafrost thaw will add 0.9°C and increased bacterial respiration will add 0.02°C.",1
"We note that the Earth has never in its history had a quasi-stable state that is around 2C warmer than the preindustrial and suggest that there is substantial risk that the system, itself, will ‘want’ to continue warming because of all of these other processes – even if we stop emissions,” she said.",1
The heatwave we now have in Europe is not something that was expected with just 1C of warming,1
"The jet stream controls broad weather patterns, such as high-pressure and low-pressure systems.",1
The extent of climate change’s influence on the jet stream is an intense subject of research.,1
"Last year, scientists published evidence that the conditions leading up to “stuck jet streams” are becoming more common, with warming in the Arctic seen as a likely culprit.",1
Gone are the days when scientists drew a bright line dividing weather and climate.,1
The heaviest precipitation events will become more frequent and more extreme.,1
"In Alaska, brown bears are changing their feeding habits to eat elderberries that ripen earlier.",0
Species that have a lot of plasticity tend to be generalists.,1
"And there is a lot of evidence that climate change is diminishing biodiversity, which can be seen in these alpine meadows as well.",1
current climate predictions may underestimate long-term warming by as much as a factor of two,1
This could mean the landmark Paris Climate Agreement – which seeks to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels – may not be enough to ward off catastrophe.,1
"In looking at Earth’s past, scientists can predict what the future will look like",0
The research also revealed how large areas of the polar ice caps could collapse and significant changes to ecosystems could see the Sahara Desert become green and the edges of tropical forests turn into fire-dominated savanna.,1
"While an isolated heatwave can be put down as an anomaly, the scale of this phenomenon points to global warming as the culprit, scientists said.",1
"‘Summers keep getting hotter,’ said Friederike Otto of the University of Oxford, who conducted extensive research into data from the heatwave that spread Europe in June, July and August 2017.",1
‘Heatwaves are far more intense than when my parents were growing up in the 1950s.,1
"‘If we do nothing to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, the kind of extreme heat we saw this past summer will be the norm when my young son is a grown man.’",1
the kind of extreme heat we saw this past summer will be the norm,1
"But despite [the Gulf Stream], the summer of 2018 looks set to be one of the hottest on record.",1
"Their ECS estimate is 1.5 degrees, with a probability range between 1.05 and 2.45 degrees.",0
"But it is part of a long list of studies from independent teams (as this interactive graphic shows), using a variety of methods that take account of critical challenges, all of which conclude that climate models exhibit too much sensitivity to greenhouse gases.",0
"If ECS is as low as the Energy Balance literature suggests, it means that the climate models we have been using for decades run too hot and need to be revised.",0
"That’s because as Antarctica’s mass shrinks, the ice sheet’s gravitational pull on the ocean relaxes somewhat, and the seas travel back across the globe to pile up far away — with U.S. coasts being one prime destination.”",1
"The Rio Grande is a classic “feast or famine” river, with a dry year or two typically followed by a couple of wet years that allow for recovery.",1
"If warming temperatures brought on by greenhouse gas emissions make wet years less wet and dry years even drier, as scientists anticipate, year-to-year recovery will become more difficult.",1
The effect of long-term warming is to make it harder to count on snowmelt runoff in wet times,1
"Last year, though, was a wet one on the Rio Grande, with a strong snowpack in the winter of 2016-17 that allowed the conservancy district to store water in upstream reservoirs.",1
"Temperatures in the Southwest increased by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit (one degree Celsius) from 1901 to 2010, and some climate models forecast a total rise of six degrees or more by the end of this century.",1
"A longer and warmer growing season also has an effect, Dr. Overpeck said, as plants take up more water, further reducing stream flows.",0
The noted oceanographer Walter Munk referred to sea-level rise as an “enigma”,0
"I note particularly that sea-level rise is not affected by the warming; it continues at the same rate, 1.8 millimeters a year, according to a 1990 review by Andrew S. Trupin and John Wahr.",0
"The trend has been measured by a network of tidal gauges, many of which have been collecting data for over a century.",1
"I conclude that it must be ice accumulation, through evaporation of ocean water, and subsequent precipitation turning into ice.",1
"Currently, sea-level rise does not seem to depend on ocean temperature, and certainly not on CO2.",0
By 2100 the seas will rise another 6 inches or so—a far cry from Al Gore’s alarming numbers,1
Mr. Singer is a professor emeritus of environmental science at the University of Virginia.,1
"Some experts think we’re on track to hit 550 ppm by the end of the century, which would cause average global temperatures to rise by 6 degrees Celsius",0
an individual heatwave triggering coral bleaching cannot be linked to global warming as the process triggering an individual heatwave is fundamentally different from that triggering global warming,1
‘there will not be enough nitrogen available to sustain the high carbon uptake scenarios.’,1
"The Arctic’s carbon bomb might be even more potent than we thought […] methane, a shorter-lived but far harder-hitting gas that could cause faster bursts of warming",1
"“Although the extent of the summer sea ice after 2006 dropped abruptly to levels not expected until 2050, the predicted 67-per-cent decline in polar bear numbers simply didn’t happen.",0
"Rather, global polar bear numbers have been stable or slightly improved.”",0
"“For example, Canadian polar bear biologist Ian Stirling learned in the 1970s that spring sea ice in the southern Beaufort Sea periodically gets so thick that seals depart, depriving local polar bears of their prey and causing their numbers to plummet.",0
"while it’s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s, there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice.",0
"Using satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level, since it provides measurements of the open ocean.",1
"Sea level rise of 65 centimeters, or roughly 2 feet would cause significant problems for coastal cities around the world.",1
"In the process, the cows will emit much greenhouse gas, and they will consume far more calories in beans than they will yield in meat, meaning far more clearcutting of forests to farm cattle feed than would be necessary if the beans above were simply eaten by people.”",1
"When the heat buildup in the ocean is taken into account, global temperatures are rising relentlessly.",1
"“We indicated 23 years ago — in our 1994 Nature article — that climate models had the atmosphere’s sensitivity to CO2 much too high,” Christy said in a statement.",1
climate models predict too much warming in the troposphere,1
"While many scientists have acknowledged the mismatch between model predictions and actual temperature observations, few have really challenged the validity of the models themselves.",1
"A recent study led by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory climate scientist Ben Santer found that while the models ran hot, the ‘overestimation’ was ‘partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the post-2000 external forcings used in the model simulations.’",0
"While volcanic eruptions are natural events, it was the timing of these that had such a noticeable effect on the trend",1
"‘While volcanic eruptions are natural events, it was the timing of these that had such a noticeable effect on the trend.",1
"If the same eruptions had happened near the more recent end of the dataset, they could have pushed the overall trend into negative numbers, or a long-term cooling,’ Christy said.”",1
policies based on previous climate model output and predictions might need to be reconsidered,1
"“Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings.",0
Scientists used to think that ice sheets could take millennia to respond to changing climates,1
"“‘If you remove the ice shelf, there’s a potential that not just ice-cliff instabilities will start occurring, but a process called marine ice-sheet instabilities,’ says Matthew Wise, a polar scientist at the University of Cambridge.",1
A fast transition away from fossil fuels in the next few decades could be enough to put off rapid sea-level rise for centuries.,0
"The sea was much colder than previously thought, the study suggests, indicating that climate change is advancing at an unprecedented rate”",1
The new research showed that [oxygen isotopes in foraminifera] can change,1
Global human emissions are only 3 per cent of total annual emissions.,0
"The past shows that climate change is normal, that warmer times and more atmospheric carbon dioxide have driven biodiversity and that cold times kill.”",0
“The worldwide temperature record has been changed.,1
[South Australia] has the most expensive electricity in the world.,1
"Australia’s signed a suicide note [with the Paris Accord] yet didn’t seem to notice that China, India, Indonesia and the US did not commit to reducing their large carbon dioxide emissions.",0
"The grasslands, crops, forests and territorial waters of Australia absorb more carbon dioxide than Australia emits.",0
‘But even if an organism isn’t directly harmed by acidification it may be affected indirectly through changes in its habitat or changes in the food web.’,1
And some plants – like algae which use carbon for photosynthesis – may even benefit.,1
[…]You can think of global warming as one type of climate change.,1
"The broader term covers changes beyond warmer temperatures, such as shifting rainfall patterns.”",1
“We’ve known about [the greenhouse effect] for more than a century.,0
[CO2] has increased 43 percent above the pre-industrial level so far,1
Geologists say that humans are now pumping the gas into the air much faster than nature has ever done.,1
"The warming is extremely rapid on the geologic time scale, and no other factor can explain it as well as human emissions of greenhouse gases.",1
"Instead of negotiating over climate change policies and trying to make them more market-oriented, some political conservatives have taken the approach of blocking them by trying to undermine the science.",1
“Scientists have published strong evidence that the warming climate is making heat waves more frequent and intense.,1
But experts say the energy transition needs to speed up drastically to head off the worst effects of climate change.,1
"Converting to these cleaner sources [of energy] may be somewhat costlier in the short term, but they could ultimately pay for themselves by heading off climate damages and reducing health problems associated with dirty air.",1
‘Clean coal’ is an approach in which the emissions from coal-burning power plants would be captured and pumped underground.,1
Climate Models Have Overestimated Global Warming,0
the climate models have overestimated the amount of global warming and failed to predict what climatologists call the warming ‘hiatus’,1
that likewise determined that the actual increases in warming post-2000 was ‘generally smaller than trends estimated’ from the models.”,1
"The team of climate scientists notes that in failing to predict the warming ‘hiatus’ in the beginning of the 21st century, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models overestimated temperature increases…",0
"The answer lies in the summer’s record-breaking heat, say wildfire experts.",1
the total area burned in the western United States over the past 33 years was double the size it would have been without any human-caused warming.,1
But [climate scientists] say that aspects of the case of Hurricane Harvey—and the recent history of tropical cyclones worldwide—suggest global warming is making a bad situation worse.,1
The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm,0
Global Ocean Circulation Appears To Be Collapsing Due To A Warming Planet,1
Evidence is growing that the comparatively cold zone within the Northern Atlantic could be due to a slowdown of this global ocean water circulation.,1

parts of the Earth will likely become close to uninhabitable,1
"Or the news from Antarctica this past May, when a crack in an ice shelf grew 11 miles in six days, then kept going; the break now has just three miles to go — by the time you read this, it may already have met the open water, where it will drop into the sea one of the biggest icebergs ever, a process known poetically as ‘calving.’",1
"In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.",1
"“The IPCC reports also don’t fully account for the albedo effect (less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight, hence more warming); more cloud cover (which traps heat); or the dieback of forests and other flora (which extract carbon from the atmosphere).",1
"The most notorious was 252 million years ago; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees, accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic, and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead.”",1
"Which means that if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give them.”",1
"as the pathbreaking work by Rosamond Naylor and David Battisti has shown, the tropics are already too hot to efficiently grow grain, and those places where grain is produced today are already at optimal growing temperature — which means even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining productivity.",1
"None of these places, which today supply much of the world’s food, will be reliable sources of any.",0

"They do not make a definitive attribution statement, but the data are consistent with and strongly suggestive of human-driven warming as a root cause of the oxygen decline.’”",1
"Because oxygen in the global ocean is not evenly distributed, the 2 percent overall decline means there is a much larger decline in some areas of the ocean than others.",1

"'To suddenly label CO2 as a ""pollutant"" is a disservice to a gas that has played an enormous role in the development and sustainability of all life on this wonderful Earth.",0
Mother Earth has clearly ruled that CO2 is not a pollutant.',0
"Although it has some very important and beneficial effects, CO2 meets the legal and encyclopedic definitions of a ""pollutant"", and human CO2 emissions pose a threat to public health and welfare.",1
This growth stimulation occurs because CO2 is one of the two raw materials (the other being water) that are required for photosynthesis.,1
"Less energy is escaping to space: Carbon dioxide (CO2) acts like a blanket; adding more CO2 makes the 'blanket' thicker, and humans are adding more CO2 all the time.",1

"With 32 years of  rapidly increasing global temperatures and only a minor increase in  global CO2 emissions, followed by 33 years of slowly cooling global  temperatures with rapid increases in global CO2 emissions, it was  deceitful for the IPCC to make any claim that CO2 emissions were  primarily responsible for observed 20th century global warming.""",0
"Even during a period of long term warming, there are short periods of cooling due to climate variability.",1
Short term cooling over the last few years is largely due to a strong La Nina phase in the Pacific Ocean and a prolonged solar minimum.,1

Greenhouse gases have been the main contributor of warming since 1970.,1
"Furthermore, it is physically incorrect to state that the planet is simply ""recovering"" from the Little Ice Age.",1
"There are a number of forcings which affect climate (eg - stratospheric aerosols, solar variations).",1
"When all forcings are combined, they show good correlation to global temperature throughout the 20th century including the mid-century cooling period.",0

"In 1946, PDO switched to a cool phase.",1
"In 1977, PDO switched to a warm phase.",1
The long term warming trend indicates the total energy in the Earth's climate system is increasing due to an energy imbalance.,0
